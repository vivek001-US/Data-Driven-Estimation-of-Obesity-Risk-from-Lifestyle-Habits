#   Data Driven Estimation of Obesity Risk from Lifestyle Habits
The obesity prediction project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to classify and predict obesity levels based on individual lifestyle data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 17 features such as age, gender, dietary habits, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body measurements. Data preprocessing involved label encoding, BMI calculation, standardization, and splitting into training and testing sets. The study applied various machine learning models across classification, regression, and clustering tasks. For classification, algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest were used. Among these, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, indicating its strong performance in handling the complex, non-linear relationships in the data. In regression analysis, models such as Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were implemented, with the Random Forest Regressor again outperforming others with a low RMSE of 7.18 and a high RÂ² score of 0.93. Clustering was performed using the K-Means algorithm, which grouped individuals into five distinct clusters, revealing hidden lifestyle patterns and one notably rare cluster, suggesting potential outlier behaviors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning, especially ensemble methods like Random Forest, in accurately estimating obesity levels from behavioral and physiological indicators. The study concludes that such data-driven approaches can play a significant role in health risk assessment and opens avenues for future work involving time-series data, deep learning models, and the development of practical applications such as web platforms or mobile apps for personalized health recommendations.
